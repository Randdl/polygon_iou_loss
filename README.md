This project is still ongoing. The implementation of polygon iou loss is in fixed_polygon_iou_loss.py. The function name is batch_poly_iou.
This repository only contains the implementation on Faster-rcnn. Others can be found in my other repositories.
There are many (mostly) ugly and uncommented codes, and unstructured files. I will make things beautiful after everything is finished.
